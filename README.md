# Advent of Code 2025 (Python)

My solutions for Advent of Code 2025, solved in Python.

## Structure

- One file per day/part (for example: `day8.py`, `day8_part2.py`).
- Inputs are stored as plain text files (for example: `input.txt`).


## Run

Run a specific day/part script:

```bash
python day8.py
python day8_part2.py
```

Most scripts expect an `input.txt` in the repo root.
